# pre-commit-hooks

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

A collection of git pre-commit hooks to use with pre-commit.com. Currently, we
have: 

* `devtools-document`: A hook to run `devtools::document()`.

To add a pre-commit hook to your project, install pre-commit as described in the 
[official documentation](https://pre-commit.com/#intro) and make sure the 
executable `pre-commit` is in a place that is on your `$PATH`.

If you installed pre-commit, you can add it to a specific project by adding a
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` file that has a structure like this: 

``` yaml
-   repo: https://github.com/lorenzwalthert/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: dcdeae2f8c96a59fab4e8f327af3fe5b050d834a
    hooks: 
    -   id: devtools-document
````


Then, run `pre-commit install` in your repo and you are done. The next time
you run `$ git commit`, the hooks listed in your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`  will
get exeuted before the commit.

[Pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com) are tests that run each time you
attempt to commit. If the tests pass, the commit will be made, otherwise not. A
very basic test is to check if the code is parsable, making sure you have not
forgotten a comma, brace or quote.

The goal of this package is to twofold: 

- Provide a set of hooks that are useful when your git repo contains R code.
  You can find them under `vignette("available-hooks")`.

- Provide [usethis](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis)-like functionality for 
  common tasks such as installation and set-up and config file modification.

## Installation

Please make sure you have conda installed. The rest can be handled from R:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# once on your system
remotes::install_github("lorenzwalthert/precommit")
precommit::install_precommit()

# once in every git repo either
# * after cloning a repo that already uses pre-commit or
# * if you want introduce pre-commit to this repo
precommit::use_precommit()
```

This installs pre-commit and performs some other set-up tasks. If you don't want
to use conda, see `vignette("manual-installation")` for alternative installation
methods. 

## Usage 

The next time you run `git commit`, the hooks listed in your
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` will get executed before the commit. The helper
function `precommit::open_config()` let's you open the
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` conveniently from the RStudio console. When any file
is changed due to running a hook, the commit will fail. You can inspect the
changes introduced by the hook and if satisfied, you can attempt to commit
again. If all hooks pass, the commit is made. You can also [temporarily disable
hooks](https://pre-commit.com/#temporarily-disabling-hooks). If you succeed, it
should look like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/screenshot.png")
```

See the hooks provided by this repo under `vignette("available-hooks")`. You can
also add other hooks from other repos, by extending the
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` file, e.g. like this:

```yaml
-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/precommit
    rev: v1.2.3
    hooks: 
    -   id: check-added-large-files
```

To update the hook revisions, just run `pre-commit autoupdate` in your terminal
of `precommit::autoupdate()`.

## Caution 

**Do not abort while hooks are running.** Non-staged changes are stashed to a
temp directory when the hooks are run and may not easily be recovered
afterwards.

## Documentation

The [online documentation](https://lorenzwalthert.github.io/precommit/index.html) 
of this package only covers the functionality added on top of pre-commit by this
package. Everything else is covered in the extensive [online documentation](https://pre-commit.com) of the pre-commit framework itself, 
including how to: 

- create pre-push hooks 
- create local hooks
- and more

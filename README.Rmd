# pre-commit-hooks

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

A collection of git pre-commit hooks to use with pre-commit.com. Currently, we
have: 

* `devtools-document`: A hoock to run `devtools::document()`.

To add a pre-commit hook to your project, install pre-commit as described in the 
[official documentation](https://pre-commit.com/#intro) and make sure the 
executable `pre-commit` is in a place that is on your `$PATH`.

If you installed pre-commit, you can add it to a specific project by adding a
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` file that has a structure like this: 

Then, run `pre-commit install` in your repo and you are done. The next time
you run `$ git commit`, the hooks listed in your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` will
be executed before the commit.

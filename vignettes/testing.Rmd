pre-commit >= 2.11.0 supports R as a language and each hook repo has its own
virtual environment with package versions locked. For that reason, we should
also test with exactly these versions.

This package has three testing worfklows:

* hook testing. Tests the hooks (as well as hook script helpers?) in the renv in
  which they'll be shipped. No R CMD Check or pre-commit executable needed.
  All platforms. To avoid convolution of the testing environment
  (that contains testthat and other packages) and the hook environment
  (specified in `renv.lock`), we must only activate the hook environment right
  when the script is called, but `run_test()` must run in the testing
  environment. Since `--vanilla` is inherited in the child process initiated
  from `run_test()`, the only way to do this is to set an env variable when
  running `run_test()` and check in the user R profile if it is set, and then
  activate the renv. This is done with `R_PRECOMMIT_HOOK_ENV`.
  
* complete testing: Tests hooks as well as usethis like access functionality 
  with latest CRAN packges, on all platforms, with all installation methods.

* CRAN testing. On CRAN, complete testing is ran, tests that check pre-commit
  executable access are disabled.

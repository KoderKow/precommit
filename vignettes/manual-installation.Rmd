Apart from `precommit::use_precommit()`, you can install pre-commit
manually as described in the [official
documentation](https://pre-commit.com/#intro). Then, set the R option
`precommithooks.executable` to the path where the pre-commit executable lives.

If you've installed pre-commit, you can add it to a specific project by adding a
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` file that has a structure like this:

``` yaml
repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/lorenzwalthert/precommit
    rev: v0.0.0.9016
    hooks: 
    -   id: style-files
    -   id: parsable-R
    -   id: no-browser-statement
    -   id: readme-rmd-rendered
    -   id: roxygenize
    -   id: use-tidy-description
    -   id: deps-in-desc
    -   id: lintr
```
The `repo` key points to the place where the source code of the hooks are stored, 
not the repo you want to apply them to.

Some hooks also take arguments, see `vignette("hook-arguments")`.

If you want to see the file `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in RStudio, you have to
enable "Show Hidden Files" in the *Files* Pane of RStudio under *More*.

Next, run `pre-commit install` in your repo and you are done.
